# MACTAB: Interactive Configurator for Partitions

MACTAB manufactures industrial floor-to-ceiling partitions. I built a browser-based configurator so sales and clients could explore fabrics, panels, locks, blinds, handles, and glass options without needing custom renders for every request.

**Focus**
Guided steps keep selections valid and obvious. Real-time previews reflect material and hardware choices, and exports stay clean for manufacturing handoff.

Users pick fabrics, panels, locks, blinds, handles, and glass, seeing changes immediately instead of waiting on static renders. Inline validation blocks incompatible mixes while presets give sales a sensible starting point, and the flow stays fast enough to run on-site with customers.

That translated into fewer back-and-forth cycles for quotes—a single PDF plus snapshot covers the spec. Sales reps use the same data-driven options, keeping outputs consistent, and prospects engage longer because they can experiment safely without breaking constraints.

The UI guides users through options, validating combinations and updating previews immediately. Exports capture selections so the factory team can act without back-and-forth.
