LYSZT is my personal portfolio: a fast, maintainable site that highlights case studies without getting in the way.

## Objectives
Navigation stays simple and consistent across posts and case studies. Performance is prioritized on desktop and mobile with lightweight assets, and content updates are straightforward—no layout surprises when adding new work.

## Build and content
The site uses a minimal grid-based layout, a restrained color palette, and generous whitespace for readability. Structured sections—hero, case summaries, CTAs—let new entries slot in cleanly, while optimized images and compressed assets keep the experience snappy.
