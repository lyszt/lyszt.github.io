# LYGON - Creative Production and Delivery

Lygon Xin is the umbrella for my video, animation, and supporting web work. I handle branding, editing, and delivery for a range of clients—from influencers defining their voice to teams in Canada and the United States that need reliable promo and internal videos. The toolkit stays consistent: After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and lightweight web builds that keep reels fast to load.

*“Lygon’s opening sequences have evolved significantly. Compare the dynamic simplistic 2016 version to the polished 2021 iteration.”*

## Working with Influencers and Businesses

I build promo, branding, and internal communications videos with a tight review loop—script, storyboard, V1/V2/final—so feedback is specific and turnarounds stay quick. Deliverables ship with thumbnails and captions for web and social. Work ranges from branding and promotional cuts tuned for target audiences to internal comms pieces that stay on-message and concise. Collaborations span influencers, entrepreneurial teams, and established businesses across Canada and the United States, all following the same disciplined process so clients always know what’s next.

## Exploring Entertainment and Wild Storytelling

Lygon Xin is also a platform for unconventional storytelling. The YouTube miniseries *Chodo and Deton* dives into immortality, clone-making, and multiverse travel—kept on track with the same production discipline (clear checkpoints, versioned cuts, and purposeful visual choices).

> If you have time to spare and a love for absurd comedy, this series is worth a watch. For client work, the same structured process applies—just with a different tone and purpose.
