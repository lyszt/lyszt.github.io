# LYGON - A Creative Journey Through Design and Videography

Lygon Xin is dedicated to my videography and design projects,
and all the portfolio related to it was created to suit a variety of clients.
I’ve worked on various projects, including branding, video editing, web design and development. All design elements
are built using modern tools like After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Illustrator.
Through Lygon, I’ve built a portfolio that caters to a wide range of clients—from influencers carving out their niche in the entertainment
industry to established companies in Canada and the United States.
