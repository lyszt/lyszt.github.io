This was a marketing site for therapist and coach Lex E. Santi. The brief: present services, books, and long-form writing in a fast, credible, and easy-to-maintain way.

Focus areas were clear pathways for coaching and clinical supervision, a responsive layout tuned for mobile visitors, and easy updates through structured content blocks rather than ad-hoc HTML.

Structured sections for services, testimonials, and CTAs keep edits consistent. Optimized assets and typography help pages load quickly and stay readable on phones, and the forms/CTAs are instrumented so we can see which services attract clicks.
