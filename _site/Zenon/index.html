<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Website for Blade Zenon:</strong> A website for a MMORPG project from 2015</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my first experience shipping something end-to-end. At 12 I built a Unity prototype, spun up a forum, and attracted 100+ active members. It never launched commercially, but it taught me how to design community features, ship fast, and respond to user feedback.</p>

<hr />

<p>Research has shown that when people feel they have a stake in the outcome of a project, their level of engagement increases. This is particularly true in online communities, where members are more likely to contribute to projects they feel are shaped by their input.</p>

<p>The idea that the success of a project hinges on the contributions of its users is supported by self-determination theory in psychology. It suggests that people are motivated when they feel competent, autonomous, and connected to others. Blade Zenon’s collaborative design allowed members to experience all three. They weren’t just passive participants; they had a direct hand in how the game developed, which likely drove their continued involvement.</p>

<p>In game development, especially in a collaborative setting, feedback loops are crucial. These loops not only help improve the game’s mechanics but also foster a sense of ownership among users. The process I went through with Blade Zenon—the cycle of receiving feedback, adjusting the design, and implementing new ideas—mirrors the concept of continuous improvement found in agile development.</p>

<p>It’s an approach that emphasizes constant iteration, and in the context of Blade Zenon, it ensured the game adapted and evolved based on real user experiences. By staying responsive to feedback, the project could refine its design and make meaningful changes in real-time. The forum architecture itself was lightweight: themed templates, clear hierarchy, and simple moderation tooling to keep discussions productive.</p>

<hr />

<p>Blade Zenon was an online game that featured a community-driven environment, where players could engage in various activities such as forming guilds and participating in discussions about game lore and mechanics. I moderated contributions, merged good ideas, and published changelog-style updates so everyone saw their input reflected in the build.</p>

<p>Members provided ideas, and I executed them. It was a game made by its players, and the lesson still applies: ship quickly, listen carefully, and let users see their fingerprints on the product.</p>
