The toolkit stays consistent: After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and lightweight web builds that keep reels fast to load.</p>

<p>I build promo, branding, and internal communications videos with a tight review loop—script, storyboard, V1/V2/final—so feedback is specific and turnarounds stay quick. Deliverables ship with thumbnails and captions for web and social. Work ranges from branding and promotional cuts tuned for target audiences to internal comms pieces that stay on-message and concise. Collaborations span influencers, entrepreneurial teams, and established businesses across Canada and the United States, all following the same disciplined process so clients always know what’s next.</p>

<p>Lygon Xin is also a platform for unconventional storytelling. The YouTube miniseries <em>Chodo and Deton</em> dives into immortality, clone-making, and multiverse travel—kept on track with the same production discipline (clear checkpoints, versioned cuts, and purposeful visual choices).</p>
