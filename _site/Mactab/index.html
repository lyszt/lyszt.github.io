<h2 id="mactab-in-focus-an-overview-of-the-company">MACTAB in Focus: An Overview of the Company</h2>

<p>MACTAB is a Brazilian manufacturer specializing in industrial floor-to-ceiling partitions and corporate solutions. The company serves a diverse range of clients across commercial and corporate sectors, providing customizable partition systems that meet specific spatial and aesthetic requirements. As businesses increasingly seek tailored office solutions, MACTAB’s ability to offer personalized products positions them competitively in the Brazilian market.</p>

<p>As of my engagement with MACTAB, the challenge was clear: how could they present their complex product offerings online in a way that allowed potential clients to visualize and personalize their solutions before making purchase decisions?</p>

<p><img src="https://mactab.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logo-mactab-novo.png" alt="Mactab Logo" /></p>

<h2 id="my-role-front-end-development-and-design">My Role: Front-End Development and Design</h2>

<p>I worked with MACTAB as their front-end developer, responsible for implementing the website design and developing the interactive features that would differentiate MACTAB from competitors in the industrial partition space. This role encompassed building responsive layouts, creating interactive components, and developing the visual content that brought their product offerings to life online.</p>

<p>The primary objective was to create a digital experience that reflected MACTAB’s commitment to customization and quality. Rather than presenting static product catalogs, the website needed to engage potential clients and provide them with tools to explore possibilities for their specific spaces.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-interactive-booth-personalization-experience">Building an Interactive Booth Personalization Experience</h2>

<p>The centerpiece of the website was an interactive office booth section where clients could personalize their partition configurations. This feature allowed users to explore different materials, finishes, glass options, panel styles, and hardware components while seeing their choices reflected in real-time visualizations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Portfolio/Web/Mactab/1.jpg" alt="Design Example 1" /></p>

<p>The interactive section was designed with user experience as the priority. Navigation remained intuitive, options were clearly presented, and the visual feedback helped clients understand how different combinations would appear in their actual spaces. This approach transformed the traditionally technical process of selecting industrial partitions into an engaging, exploratory experience.</p>

<h2 id="product-presentations-and-3d-visualizations">Product Presentations and 3D Visualizations</h2>

<p>Beyond the interactive features, I created comprehensive product presentations and 3D visualizations that showcased MACTAB’s offerings. These visual assets served multiple purposes: they provided sales teams with professional materials for client presentations, gave potential customers detailed views of product quality and construction, and elevated MACTAB’s brand perception in a market where visual presentation often determines credibility.</p>

<p>The 3D work focused on highlighting the craftsmanship and attention to detail that defined MACTAB’s products. By rendering partitions in realistic office environments, potential clients could better envision how these solutions would integrate into their spaces. These visualizations also demonstrated the range of customization options available, from minimalist designs to more elaborate configurations.</p>

<h3 id="video-demonstration">Video Demonstration</h3>

<div class="video-embed">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFG6XV8jaBE" title="MACTAB interactive configurator demo" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="design-philosophy-and-visual-identity">Design Philosophy and Visual Identity</h2>

<p>The website’s design embraced a minimalistic aesthetic that complemented MACTAB’s product line. Clean layouts, generous whitespace, and high-quality imagery created a sense of professionalism and sophistication. The color palette remained neutral, allowing the products themselves to become the visual focal points.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Portfolio/Web/Mactab/2.png" alt="Design Example 2" /></p>

<p>This design approach served a strategic purpose. In the B2B space, potential clients often evaluate suppliers based on their digital presence. A polished, professional website signals organizational competence and attention to detail—qualities that directly relate to product quality. By creating a visually refined experience, the website reinforced MACTAB’s positioning as a premium provider in their category.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-business-impact">Results and Business Impact</h2>

<p>The combination of interactive features, professional 3D visualizations, and clean web design transformed how MACTAB engaged with potential clients. The website became a powerful sales tool that allowed prospects to explore options independently before contacting the sales team. This self-service capability meant that incoming inquiries were more qualified, as clients had already spent time understanding the product range and considering their preferences.</p>

<p>For MACTAB, the investment in quality web design and interactive features represented more than aesthetic improvement. It positioned the company as innovative and client-focused, differentiating them in a market where many competitors still relied on traditional catalogs and static imagery. The digital presence I created helped MACTAB communicate their value proposition effectively and engage with modern buyers who expect sophisticated online experiences.</p>
